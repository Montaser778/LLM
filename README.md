# 🏥 LLM-based Medical Chatbot

A **Medical Chatbot** powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to provide **health-related answers and guidance** using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

This project integrates **Hugging Face Datasets** for training and evaluation, enabling accurate and context-aware medical responses.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **LLM-powered medical chatbot** for Q&A.
- ✅ Integration with **Hugging Face Datasets** for biomedical data.
- ✅ **Fine-tuning support** for transformer models (BERT, GPT, LLaMA, etc.).
- ✅ **Evaluation** on multiple medical QA datasets.
- ✅ **Easy deployment** for web or API.

## 📂 Dataset
This project leverages **medical and biomedical datasets** hosted on [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets), which provide high-quality data for training and evaluation of LLMs.

Currently used datasets:

1. **[MedQuAD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medquad)**
   - A collection of medical Q&A pairs extracted from the U.S. National Library of Medicine websites.
   - Used for fine-tuning the chatbot for reliable medical answers.

2. **[PubMedQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pubmed_qa)**
   - Biomedical Question Answering dataset from PubMed.
   - Helps in generating context-aware answers for research-based questions.

3. **[MedMCQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medmcqa)**
   - A large-scale, multiple-choice medical QA dataset.
   - Useful for improving accuracy and evaluation metrics.

You can load the dataset directly using Hugging Face:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Example: Load MedQuAD
dataset = load_dataset("medquad")

# Access train and test splits
print(dataset['train'][0])
```

---

## ⚡ Why Hugging Face Datasets?
- Pre-cleaned and **ready-to-use**.
- **Easy integration** with Transformers and PyTorch.
- Large **community and support** for reproducible ML projects.
- Compatible with **LangChain & LLM fine-tuning** pipelines.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LLM-Medical-Chatbot.git
cd LLM-Medical-Chatbot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Example

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Example: Load a QA pipeline (replace with your fine-tuned model)
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering", model="distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad")

question = "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"
context = "Diabetes symptoms include frequent urination, increased thirst, and weight loss."

print(qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context))
```
